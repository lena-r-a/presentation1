All you need to know is JavaScript, platform APIs, some native UI elements, and any other platform-specific design patterns, and you're set.</aside></section><section data-auto-animate><h2>React Native Advantages</h2><ul><li>JavaScript/React based.</li><li>Maximum code reuse & cost saving.</li></ul><aside class="notes">By using React Native, you can use the same code for deployment on iOS as well as on Android. This means a huge saving in development time and cost. Theoretically, the development effort could be cut by half.</aside></section><section data-auto-animate><h2>React Native Advantages</h2><ul><li>JavaScript/React based.</li><li>Maximum code reuse & cost saving.</li><li>Community-driven.</li></ul><aside class="notes">The developers’ community is a very powerful one. Mainly because quite often, if you’re having an issue with something code-wide, someone probably already had that issue before you. It is often memed that developers just copy-paste already written code from StackOverflow and voilà, their job’s done. Obviously, it’s not entirely true. But then, it’s not entirely false either!</aside></section><section data-auto-animate><h2>React Native Advantages</h2><ul><li>JavaScript/React based.</li><li>Maximum code reuse & cost saving.</li><li>Community-driven.</li><li>Comprehensive Libraries.</li></ul><aside class="notes">Pre-developed UI components are available with react native, meaning codes are already written, all you have to do is implement them. Additionally, it offers a lot of libraries to ease the entire application development process.</aside></section><section data-auto-animate><h2>React Native Advantages</h2><ul><li>JavaScript/React based.</li><li>Maximum code reuse & cost saving.</li><li>Community-driven.</li><li>Comprehensive Libraries.</li><li>Live/ Hot Reloading.</li></ul><aside class="notes">Live reloading facilitates a fast refresh of the code. You can see changes at once on a mobile phone. Hot reloading is another important benefit of react-native. There is just a minor difference between live and hot reloading. Live reload refreshes the entire application, whereas hot reloading only refreshes a file that has been edited or changed, all the while maintaining the original state of the application.</aside></section></section><section><section data-auto-animate><h2>React Native Coins</h2><aside class="notes">Of course there are also some coins of React Native. let's learn about them.</aside></section><section data-auto-animate><h2>React Native Coins</h2><ul><li>Not efficient design-wise.</li></ul><aside class="notes">If you consider complicated designs or advanced interactions as a crucial part of your business advantage, you should definitely go for native development.</aside></section><section data-auto-animate><h2>React Native Coins</h2><ul><li>Not efficient design-wise.</li><li>Security is Low because JavaScript Based Library.</li></ul><aside class="notes">If you are using React Native for apps which require type A security, like mobile banking apps or personal finance apps, you will need to pay extra attention to detail because JavaScript is famous for its fragility.

          </pre><aside class="notes">In react native, when we create a component, we can customize it using various different properties, and these properties are called props. Every component has its own props but we can also define and use our own props. A prop is an immutable thing that cannot be changed after declaring the component. We can't change it in the future. For example, to load an image in react native, we need to define a source that is a built-in property or props for the Image component.</aside></section><section><h2>Own props example</h2><pre>
